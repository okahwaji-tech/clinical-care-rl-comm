# Clinical Care RL Communication

A reinforcement learning system that optimizes healthcare communication using temporal Rainbow DQN for clinical decision-making and patient interaction management.

## Overview

Clinical Care RL Communication addresses the critical challenge of healthcare communication optimization by leveraging advanced reinforcement learning techniques. The system learns to make appropriate clinical decisions while considering patient risk levels, temporal constraints, and communication preferences.

### Key Capabilities

- **Temporal Rainbow DQN**: Advanced reinforcement learning with multi-dimensional action spaces for complex healthcare scenarios
- **Clinical Safety**: Built-in safety mechanisms and conservative decision-making to prevent overtreatment
- **Risk-Aware Processing**: Intelligent patient risk stratification with appropriate intervention recommendations
- **Multi-Channel Communication**: Optimization across SMS, email, phone, and mail channels
- **Comprehensive Evaluation**: Clinical appropriateness metrics and safety validation

## Healthcare Application

The system is designed specifically for healthcare environments where communication timing and appropriateness are critical. It optimizes decisions based on:

- **Patient Risk Assessment**: Tailored interventions ranging from routine monitoring to immediate clinical referral
- **Temporal Decision-Making**: Time-sensitive healthcare decisions with urgency-based prioritization
- **Communication Channel Selection**: Multi-modal communication optimization based on patient preferences and clinical urgency
- **Clinical Safety Protocols**: Conservative approach that prevents overtreatment while ensuring proper escalation of care

## Synthetic Data Generation

This project generates synthetic healthcare data for training and prediction purposes. The synthetic data generator creates realistic patient scenarios with varying risk levels, clinical conditions, and communication preferences. This approach ensures:

- **Privacy Protection**: No real patient data is used, maintaining complete privacy compliance
- **Scalable Training**: Generate large datasets (up to millions of samples) for robust model training
- **Risk Stratification**: Synthetic patients are categorized across five risk tiers (very_low to very_high) with clinically appropriate action distributions
- **Realistic Scenarios**: Generated data follows evidence-based clinical guidelines and realistic patient demographics
- **Controlled Testing**: Enables systematic evaluation across different patient risk profiles and clinical scenarios

The synthetic data includes patient demographics, medical history, risk scores, communication preferences, and appropriate clinical actions, providing a comprehensive foundation for training and validating the reinforcement learning models.

## Clinical Safety Features

The system incorporates multiple layers of clinical safety mechanisms to ensure appropriate healthcare decision-making:

### 1. Reward Shaping for Clinical Appropriateness
- **Medication Overuse Prevention**: Applies -0.3 penalty when risk score < 0.4 and action is MEDICATE
- **High-Risk Intervention Incentives**: Provides +0.3 bonus when risk score ≥ 0.7 and action is REFER or MEDICATE
- **Medical Best Practices**: Reward structure aligned with established clinical guidelines

### 2. Stratified Synthetic Data Generation
- **Risk-Tier Partitioning**: Categorizes patients into 5 risk tiers (very_low to very_high)
- **Clinically Appropriate Distributions**: Ensures >70% MONITOR/DISCHARGE actions for low-risk patients and mandatory REFER for very high-risk cases
- **Realistic Clinical Sampling**: Action probabilities based on evidence-based clinical guidelines per risk tier

### 3. Risk-Aware Prioritized Experience Replay
- **Enhanced Priority Calculation**: Applies 1.5x multiplier for high-risk patient transitions (risk_score ≥ 0.7)
- **Action-Specific Prioritization**: Increases priority for REFER and MEDICATE actions in high-risk states
- **Focused Learning**: Improves model attention to critical healthcare decisions

### 4. Adaptive Conservative Q-Learning (CQL)
- **Risk-Adaptive Regularization**: Uses α = 0.5 for high-risk states, α = 1.0 for normal states
- **Conservative Safety Approach**: Applies stronger regularization for high-risk patients
- **Decision Confidence Control**: Prevents overconfident decisions in critical clinical situations

### 5. Monotonicity Regularization
- **Risk-Ordered Q-Values**: Ensures Q_refer(state_i) ≥ Q_refer(state_j) when risk_i ≥ risk_j
- **Clinical Logic Enforcement**: Maintains logical relationship where higher-risk patients have higher referral Q-values
- **Balanced Constraint Enforcement**: Uses regularization weight β = 0.1 for optimal constraint balance

### 6. Enhanced Feature Representation
- **Improved Risk Scaling**: Rescales risk_score from [0,1] to [-1,1] for better feature alignment
- **Feature Parity**: Ensures balanced contribution across all normalized features
- **Learning Optimization**: Improves model convergence and decision quality
